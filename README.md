## Thakker Light Mist Theme (High Contrast)

One of the first and only light themes with a high contrast color palette. All syntax highlighting colors are chosen with dark palettes and hues based on contextual similarity to look good on the light background for easy reading during the day.

Throughout our lives we are trained to read dark text on a light background (like a book or a newspaper) and yet most of the readable themes with good highlighting are dark themes. This is a light background, readable theme with dark text of different colors and highlights depending on the entity type in your code.

This theme is dedicated to my current team of the same name (Mist). 

Screenshots coming soon. Tested with JavaScript and TypeScript.
