## Thakker Light Mist Theme (High Contrast)

One of the first and only light themes with a high contrast color palette. All syntax colors are chosen with dark palettes that contrast well on the light background for easy reading during the day. If the background of this theme seems too light, consider using the Thakker Light Earth or Thakker Light Sky themes, which have a beige background.

For thousands of years we have been trained to read dark text on a light background (like a book or a newspaper) and yet most of the readable themes with good highlighting are dark themes. This is a light background, readable theme with dark text of different colors and highlights to enhance readability while maintaining recognizable colors for different variable types.

This theme is dedicated to my current team of the same name (Mist).
